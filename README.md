(**W**ork **I**n **P**rogress) Encryption library for networking in Go

## Why did I create this?

I often struggled with encryption of network connections (TCP, UDP). Thats why I created this simple library to make encrypting data a breeze.
Unfortunally, I'm not done with this project so far. Please be patient.
